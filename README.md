# Open-source numerical optimization python libraries for full-waveform inversion: A Review.
This repository contains the implementation to reproduce the numerical experiments of the Geoscience Letters paper: Open-source numerical optimization python
libraries for full-waveform inversion: A Review.

👉 To find your way around the code, the `mymakefile` file is the recommended starting point. 

## Dokerization

Along with the code a `Dockerfile` from which you can build a docker image for our Python application is provided.

### Build the docker image

You can build the docker image, named myapp, with the following commands

```shell
MY_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)
docker build --build-arg SSH_KEY="$MY_KEY" --tag myapp .
```

… then wait for docker to build an image for our app (it might tight a take for downloading and update it the packages list).

> Make sure Docker is installed on your machine (www.docker.com).

### Run the container

To run all the experiments used in the paper from the docker image use

```shell
docker run --rm -ti myapp make -f mymakefile
```
This execute the `make` command with the specified Makefile (mymakefile), which invoke python scripts for `forward` modeling and `fwi`. When `make -f mymakefile` is run, `forward` will be executed first, followed by `fwi`. You also can run `fwi` with each one of the frameworks individually, i.e., `docker run --rm -ti myapp make -f mymakefile scipy`, will be execute `fwi` using `scipy`, `forward` will be executed first if it has not been executed yet

The command above should outputs:

```shell
python3 generate_shot_data.py marmousi2
